This is a very simple game made in order to teach myself Rust. 

ALMOST ALL CORE FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE GAME (Sprites, drawing, collisions, physics, pretty much everything except the game logic)
WAS BORROWED FROM:

https://github.com/drbawb/rust-story

This project uses [rust-sdl2](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2) which binds to SDL2.

To run the project:
 * Install [`rust@master`](https://github.com/mozilla/rust)
 * Compile rust-sdl2 to an `.so` or `.rlib` and place the resulting library in `lib/`
 * `make && make run`: will run rustc on `src/main.rs` linking against `lib/**`

Make targets include:
 * `make deps`:		init & update the `lib/rust-sdl2` submodule; builds it; copies the dep to `lib/`
 * `make debug`: 	time the various `rustc` passes & forcibly include debug symbols for use w/ `gdb`.
 * `make veyron`: 	time the various `rustc` passes & run a more thorough LLVM optimization pass.
 * `make clean`: 	remove any artifacts generated by the previous build.
 * `make run`		execute `bin/rust-story` :-)
